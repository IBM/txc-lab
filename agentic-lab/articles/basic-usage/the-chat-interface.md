# The Chat Interface

The Bob chat interface is your primary way of interacting with it. It's located in the Bob panel, which you can open by clicking the Bob icon (<KangaBobIcon />) in the VS Code Activity Bar.

## Components of the Chat Interface

The chat interface consists of the following main elements:

1. **Chat History:** This area displays the conversation history between you and Bob.  It shows your requests, Bob's responses, and any actions taken (like file edits or command executions).

2. **Input Field:** This is where you type your tasks and questions for Bob.  You can use plain English to communicate.

3. **Action Buttons:** These buttons appear above the input field and allow you to approve or reject Bob's proposed actions.  The available buttons change depending on the context.

4. **Send Button:** This looks like a small plane and it's located to the far right of the input field. This sends messages to Bob after you've typed them.

5. **Plus Button:** The plus button is located at the top in the header, and it resets the current session.

6. **Settings Button:** The settings button is a gear, and it's used for opening the settings to customize features or behavior.

7. **Mode Selector:** The mode selector is a dropdown located to the left of the chat input field. It is used for selecting which mode Bob should use for your tasks.

## Interacting with Messages

* **Clickable Links:** File paths, URLs, and other mentions in the chat history are clickable.  Clicking a file path will open the file in the editor.  Clicking a URL will open it in your default browser.
* **Copying Text:** You can copy text from the chat history by selecting it and using the standard copy command (Ctrl/Cmd + C).  Some elements, like code blocks, have a dedicated "Copy" button.
* **Expanding and Collapsing**: Click on a message to expand or collapse it.

## Status Indicators

* **Loading Spinner:**  When Bob is processing a request, you'll see a loading spinner.
* **Error Messages:**  If an error occurs, a red error message will be displayed.
* **Success Messages:** Green messages indicate successful completion of actions.
